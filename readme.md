# Dynamic Programming Example Implementations in C#

This solution contains example implementations to some common dynamic programming problems. The algorithms are based on the [excellent video from freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&). If you are interested in dynamic programming or simple algorithmic problem solving, I highly recommend the video which has to be one of the best videos on this topic. Please give the good folks at the [freeCodeCamp.org channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) a like and subscribe!

The solution contains C# implementations of the examples, complete with unit tests. 
## Requirements:
* Visual Studio 2019 (Community is fine)
* .NET 5 SDK
